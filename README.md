# React Router v6 Nested Route Conflict

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router v6 involving nested routes that conflict with each other. Specifically, the issue arises when a more general route (e.g., `/about`) is defined alongside a more specific route (e.g., `/about/*`) that overlaps the general route's path. This leads to unexpected rendering behavior, where only the more specific route is often used. 

## How to reproduce the bug:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll see that only the `/about/*` route renders, masking the standard `/about` route, highlighting the problem of overlapping routes.

## Solution:
The provided solution demonstrates how to resolve the conflict by refactoring the routes to avoid ambiguity and ensure that the routes do not overlap.  By removing the nested wildcard path '/about/*', the standard route '/about' will be correctly rendered.
